# Discord Virtual Classroom

Synchronous lectures will be streamed on Discord to allow interactivity in multiple ways.  In order to participate in the live lectures you will need to join Dr. Eloe's server (link provided on course websites).

## Join the appropriate Text Channel

There is a specific text channel for each course; the contents of this channel will be mirrored on the stream and the recording (to give context to questions).  Keep in mind that posting questions here will show your chosen nickname on the recording; you may want to change your nickname to something anonymous and appropriate.

The text channel will start with `lecture-` followed by a short name for the course.  For example, if you are tuning in to participate in the Survey of Algorithms lecture, you should join (double click) the `lecture-algorithms` text chat.

## Join the General Voice Channel

All lecture audio will come through the General voice channel.
This is also where students can ask questions using their microphones.  Out of politeness you may want to enable [https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/211376518-Voice-Input-Modes-101-Push-to-Talk-Voice-Activated-] Push To Talk, or mute yourself when you are not asking questions.
If you are determined to be the source of distracting ambient noise you will be muted and have to ask your questions through the text channel.

You will need to be in the voice channel to hear the lecture content.

## Watch the streamed lecture

Find me (Nathan Eloe) in the voice chat; I will have a "LIVE" indicator when the lecture has started; select my name and choose "Watch Stream" (or double click my username). See [https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030714312-Stream-your-game-with-Go-Live-#h_671405f5-793e-41ee-a806-e2ab7c2d92f3](How do I watch a stream?) for more details.

## Lecture Rules/Etiquitte

* Be polite; this is a difficult time for many people
* Be professional; you will be muted/kicked if you are being inappropriate.
* Be understanding; this is new for all of us... we'll figure it out
* Keep questions geared toward lecture material.  Questions about course structure, grades, specific assignments, etc should be moved to office hours, direct message, or email.  This will help keep the lectures
